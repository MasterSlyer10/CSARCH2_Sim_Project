# CSARCH2_Sim_Project
Cache Simulation Project
This project is a simulation of a cache system. It allows you to input the number of memory blocks and select a sequence type (sequential, random, or mid-repeat) to simulate cache hits and misses.
Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to open the index.html file in a web browser. This will launch the cache simulation interface.
Usage
Once the interface is open, you can input the number of memory blocks and select a sequence type using the buttons provided. Then, you can click the "Next Step" button to step through the simulation one memory access at a time, or click the "Final" button to run the simulation to completion. You can also click the "Clear Cache" button to reset the cache and start a new simulation.
