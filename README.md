## Overview

This project provides a simulation of a 4-way set associative cache memory system with FIFO replacement policy. It allows users to visualize cache hits, misses, and the final cache state. The simulation includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience.

## Features

- Generate sequential, random, or custom memory access sequences.
- Simulate cache hits and misses in a 4-way set associative cache with FIFO replacement policy.
- Visualize the cache state in the GUI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-simulation.git
